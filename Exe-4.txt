#6. Display the average Quantity sold for each part.
select avg(qty) as 'Average Quantity',`p#` from spj group by `p#` ;



 
#7. Display the maximum Quantity sold for each part, provided the maximum Quantity is greater than 800

SELECT MAX(QTY) MAX_QTY,`P#` FROM SPJ GROUP BY `P#` HAVING MAX_QTY>800;  



#8. Display the Status and the count of Suppliers with that Status.

SELECT STATUS,COUNT(STATUS) FROM S GROUP BY STATUS;




#9. Display the count of Projects going on in different cities.

--->COUNT(*) counts the rows in your table.

COUNT(column) counts the entries in a column - ignoring null values.;

select  
case
	when status=10 then 'Ten'
	when status=20 then 'Twenty'
	when status=30 then 'Thirty'
	else 'Null'
end 'status' , count(status) from s group by status;
