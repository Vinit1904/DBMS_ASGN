#1) Create a table called Cityorders. This will contain the same onum, amt and snum fields as the Orders table, and the same cnum and
 #city fields as the Customers table, so that each customerâ€™s order will be entered into this table along with his or her city. 
 #Onum will be the primary key of Cityorders.
# All of the fields in Cityorders will be constrained to match the Customers and Orders tables.
 #Assume the parent keys in these tables already have the proper constraints.
 
 CREATE TABLE CITYORDERS
 AS
 SELECT ONUM,AMT,orders.SNUM,customers.CNUM,CITY FROM orders,customers
 where orders.CNUM=customers.CNUM;
 
 ALTER TABLE CITYORDERS ADD PRIMARY KEY(ONUM); 
 

 
 
 
#32) Redefine the Orders table as follows:- add a new column called prev, which will identify, for each order, the onum of the
# previous order for that current customer. 
# Implement this with a foreign key referring to the Orders table itself. 
# The foreign key should refer as well to the cnum of the customer, providing a definite enforced link between the current order and 
# the one referenced. 

ALTER TABLE ORDERS ADD PREV INT(4);	

ALTER TABLE cityorders ADD
FOREIGN key(cnum) REFERENCES customers(cnum);

 
ALTER TABLE copy_orders ADD
FOREIGN key(prev) REFERENCES copy_orders(onum);
